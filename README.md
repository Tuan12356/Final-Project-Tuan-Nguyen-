# Final Project Tuan Nguyen
  Introduction
  The purpose of this device is to create traffic lights using a raspberry pi. This is a device when the button is pressed the light turn on similar to a traffic light on the road. The light turns on from red to yellow and finally green.  

Stage 1: Program the traffic light, this includes setting up the correct wire for the traffic light using jumper wire, button, switch, buzzer and resistor. 

Stage 2: Write a program using python in raspberry pi to program traffic light duration when to turn on and off. Write a program to   program the traffic light using GPIO Zero.   

Stage 3: Test the program to see if the smart traffic light system works.

1x Raspberry pi model 4b
1x Breadboard
All king of jumper leads 
1x button
3x LEDs (Red, Green, and Yellow)
