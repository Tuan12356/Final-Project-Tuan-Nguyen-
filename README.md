# Final Project Tuan Nguyen
The purpose of this device is to create traffic lights using a raspberry pi. This is a device when the button is pressed the light turn on similar to a traffic light on the road. The light turns on from red to yellow and green.  

Stage 1: Program the traffic light, this includes setting up the correct wire for the traffic light using jumper wire, button, switch, buzzer and resistor. 

Stage 2: Write a program using python in raspberry pi to program traffic light duration when to turn on and off.  

Stage 3: Write a program to import buttons, buzzers and traffic lights using GPIO Zero. 

Stage 4: Test the program to see if the smart traffic light system works.
