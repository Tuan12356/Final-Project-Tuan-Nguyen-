# Final Project Tuan Nguyen
  Introduction
  The purpose of this device is to create traffic lights using a raspberry pi. This is a device when the button is pressed the lights are going to turn on like a traffic light on the road. The light turns on from red to yellow and finally green. 

Stage 1: Program the traffic light, this includes setting up the correct wire for the traffic light using jumper wire, button, switch, buzzer, and resistor. 

Stage 2: Write a program using python in raspberry pi to program traffic light duration when to turn on and off. Write a program to   program the traffic light using GPIO Zero. 

Stage 3: Test the program to see if the smart traffic light system works. 


Parts Needed for the Project.
1 Raspberry pi model 4b
1 Breadboard
7 jumper wires
1 button
3 LEDs (Red, Green, and Yellow)
3 330-ohm Resistor
1 Buzzer
