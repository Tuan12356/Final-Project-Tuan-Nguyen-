# Final Project Traffic Lights Tuan Nguyen
                                                      Introduction
  
  The purpose of this device is to create traffic lights using a raspberry pi. This is a device when the button is pressed the lights are going to turn on like a traffic light on the road. The light turns on from red to yellow and finally green. 

Stage 1: Gather all the require parts in order to setup the traffic light. This  includes setting up the correct wire for the traffic light using jumper wire, button, switch, buzzer, and resistor. 

Stage 2: Write a script using python in raspberry pi to turn the traffic light LED  on/off using GPIO Zero.Write another script to turn the buzzer on when the light in a sequence.

Stage 3: Add in the button and write a script to program the traffic light to turn on when a user press the button.And, finally test the program to see if the smart traffic light system works.
